        <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, sliced</li>

        <li>1 block (14 ounces) firm tofu, drained and crumbled</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup vegan mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until translucent and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the bell pepper, zucchini, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Stir in the baby spinach and cook for an additional 2 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the crumbled tofu and nutritional yeast. Mix well to coat the tofu with the nutritional yeast.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the tofu mixture evenly over the noodles, followed by half of the sautéed vegetables. Repeat this process with another layer of noodles, tofu mixture, and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Place the final layer of noodles on top and spread the remaining marinara sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle vegan mozzarella cheese evenly over the top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
